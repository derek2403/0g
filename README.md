# PrivTrain

A decentralized federated learning framework built on **0G** that enables privacy-preserving collaborative model training. Participants train models locally on their own data, submit encrypted weight updates via **0G Storage**, coordinate training rounds through **on-chain smart contracts**, and mint the final trained model as an **ERC-7857 INFT** (Intelligent NFT).

## Demo

**Live:** [https://0g-nine.vercel.app](https://0g-nine.vercel.app)

## How It Works

```
Coordinator creates task  -->  Participants register on-chain
        |                              |
        v                              v
Upload initial model          Upload labeled images
to 0G Storage                 Train locally (MobileNet + TF.js)
        |                              |
        v                              v
On-chain task created         Upload weights to 0G Storage
                              Submit Merkle root on-chain
                                       |
                                       v
                              Coordinator aggregates (FedAvg)
                              New global model uploaded
                              Metrics recorded on-chain
                                       |
                                       v
                              Repeat until final round
                                       |
                                       v
                              Model minted as ERC-7857 INFT
                              Use model / Download (.json, .pkl)
```

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- MetaMask with [0G Galileo testnet](https://chainscan-galileo.0g.ai) configured
- 0G testnet tokens from the [faucet](https://faucet.0g.ai)

### Setup

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Copy environment variables
cp .env.example .env
```

Fill in `.env`:

```env
# Private key for server-side 0G Storage operations
ZG_STORAGE_PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here

# WalletConnect project ID (https://cloud.walletconnect.com)
NEXT_PUBLIC_WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID=your_project_id_here

# Deployed contract address
NEXT_PUBLIC_FL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=0xc4e07a3716c2bCF814A1D4423C50532ebA71cC54
```

### Run

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

### Demo Flow

1. **Pre-setup:** Go to `/demo`, configure task name and classes, click "Setup Demo" (~1 min). This creates a task at round 1/2 with one simulated training round.

2. **Create a task:** Go to `/create` to show live task creation with custom classes.

3. **Participate & train:** Go to `/participate/[taskId]` on the pre-set task:
   - Register as participant (on-chain tx)
   - Upload labeled images (select class per batch)
   - Train locally via MobileNet V2 transfer learning in-browser
   - Submit trained weights to 0G Storage + proof on-chain

4. **Aggregate & mint:** Go to `/tasks/[taskId]` as coordinator:
   - View all submissions
   - Click Aggregate - downloads updates from 0G Storage, runs FedAvg, uploads new model
   - Task completes - ERC-7857 INFT automatically minted

5. **Use the model:** Go to `/use`:
   - Select completed model from sidebar
   - Upload any image - model classifies with confidence scores
   - View INFT details, training metrics history, explorer links
   - Download as `.json` (TF.js) or `.pkl` (Python/NumPy)

### Redeploying Contracts

```bash
cd contracts
npm install
npx hardhat compile
echo "y" | npx hardhat ignition deploy ignition/modules/FederatedLearningINFT.js --network zgTestnet --deployment-id fl-v3
```

Update `NEXT_PUBLIC_FL_CONTRACT_ADDRESS` in `.env` with the new address.
